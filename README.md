## Fast local setup

You can start this website locally by using these easy steps (python3 is needed):

- Clone this repo to your pc;
- Create virtual environment (if needed) with ```virtualenv venv```, activate it and install dependencies with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```;
- At the top of ```project/settings.py``` set ```EASY_RUN_MODE``` from ```False``` to ```True```;
- Start server with```python manage.py runserver``` or ```python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:1234``` to open it to local network (for example, over wifi).

TAKE A NOTE that without postgresql, you can't use migrations, therefore, can't use any database-related actions. Generators will work of course.
